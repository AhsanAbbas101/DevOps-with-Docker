App Size Before: 1.28GB

> Previously the base image being used was node:16 which has a size of 909MB. I replaced it with 16-alpine which has a size of 118MB.
> I combined the RUN statements for building the project and adding a user. I also tried to combine the RUN statements for installing node packages and building the project (say e.g incase of production build) but the size of the image remains the same.


App Size Now: 491MB
